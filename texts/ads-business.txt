Why I Wrote Hooked
For an entrepreneur, there is always one nagging question that has to be answered every single day: What should we build next? As the CEO of two tech companies, this question awaited me as soon as I opened my laptop in the morning and was still on my mind when I turned out the lights before bed each night. 
“What do we build next?” is such an important question because the answer determines whom you hire, how much you spend, and, most importantly, whether your company will succeed or fail. The building pahse is where your blood, sweat, and tears (not to mention money) all go. But how do we decide what to build? What determines which projects we should invest in improving versus which ones we should ignore?
For most of the history of product development, employees built whatever the boss wanted them to build. The leader of the company sent down orders from on high and teams got to work turning that vision into reality. Sometimes, the executive was right and the innovation would be successful, but most often those at the top were wrong. Product teams would spend months if not years (typically isolated from customers) building products that no one ultimately wanted. The lack of user input led to countless product failures.
More recently, a new philosophy of innovation has changed the way many companies do business. Entrepreneurs-turned-authors such as Steve Blank and Eric Ries have promoted building products through continuous improvements by constantly testing and validating ideas with customers. By listening to customer feedback, they argue, companies can decrease the odds of building something no one really wants. I am a subscriber and advocate of Blank and Ries’ process of “customer development.” However, I found something missing when I implemented their methodology—the answer to that same nagging question regarding what to build.

The challenge facing consumers today is that we get up to 5,000 marketing messages a day. Too often these ads are used to interrupt consumer’s entertainment, instead of adding value to the context the message is served. As a marketer, it’s tougher than ever to break through this clutter. Catching the consumer’s attention and moving them to action is becoming increasingly more difficult. So why not make it easy on yourself? Portray is the perfect marketing vehicle to inspire shoppers to follow a curiosity or passion, and immediately convert it into a purchasing experience. Showcase relevant updates on the latest products, promotions and can’t-miss events while daily shoppers are within close proximity to the point-of-purchase and in the purchasing state of mind. No other media platform can close the gap between an impression and instant gratification like Portray.
So it’s 2:00 in the morning...and you’re starving. Nothin’ in the fridge, and nothin’ in the cupboards. You don’t even have dog biscuits hangin’ around. You think about cooking, but then you remember the 3-alarm fire you started last time you tried using the stove. Well, check out 7-11. There’s gotta be one right near ya’. They have everything from burgers to tacos...24 hours a day...7 days a week. 7-11. Think of it as your own personal walk-in kitchen.

“Alpaca Farmer”
2/12/03
SFX: Livestock bleating.
VO: I came to a point in my career when I knew I could make more money and handle more responsibility.  It was just a matter of talking that next step.  So I quit the bank and became an alpaca farmer.  In hindsight, I wish I’d enrolled in the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business at DePaul University.  But at the time I thought raising alpacas would give me the managerial skills and cash flow I wanted.  Now, rather than saying I went to DePaul’s nationally ranked MBA program, my resume lists the names of alpacas I’ve helped deliver.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s rewarding in its own way.  I just don’t know many people who earn six figures doing it.  Or five figures for that matter.  So take my advice, go to DePaul.  Oh, and wear gloves when you’re an alpaca midwife.

“Your building or historic landmark, says a lot about you.
“When new or restored it is a crowning achievement to architecture and craftsmanship.
“From the architectural detailing to the colors and shapes of stone and brick, your building is a tribute to times gone by.
“Embodying the values of business or heritage, your name is now attached to that history.  You are proud to have clients, visitors or passersby admire this treasured asset and you proudly hang your plaque on the cornerstone.”

“What Fans Endure”
Announcer:  People always talk about how hard football is on pro players’ bodies.  About the beating their knees take.  Their concussions, torn ligaments and broken bones.  But for a couple of million dollars a year, what do they have to complain about?  What about you, the fan, and the pain you endure in the name of football?

Heroes of the Imperium
In the nightmare future of the 41st millennium, mankind teeters upon the brink of extinction.
The ever expanding Imperium of Man is beset on all sides by untrustworthy aliens, and malevolent creatures.
It is further threatened from within by heretic rebels. Battle Brothers who have turned against us for the promise of Dark Powers.
Only the strength of the immortal Emperor stands between humanity and its annihilation.
The Space Marines act as the hand of the Emperor, enforcing his will upon the galaxy and cleansing its worlds for the people of the Imperium.
For these extraordinary men and women, only in death does their duty to the Emperor end.

Clinching the Big deal.

I wanted to be the Big Man,
I never wanted to be the little man.

And she'll turn to me
rolling her Big blue eyes,

I retort, “What's the Big Deal?”
And give her a Big kiss.
And I'll get in my Big car,
set off into the Big wide world,
she'll give me a Big wave,
close the door of our Big house,
Look in the mirror and say,
Does my bum look Big in this?
And in my Big meeting
I'll turn to one of the Big hitters
and I'll say,

This is the story of a startup. A different kind of startup. The founders didn’t meet in a boardroom. And this was headquarters. This, their venture capital. You could say they lacked a strategy. But what they had was gumption. A belief in the power of nature. Rosemary, sweet almond oil and beeswax. For nourishing, effective skincare that says, I heart you, Skin. People took notice. Sales went national. Then to Canada. Sweeping Europe. Asia. Latin America. Even Easter Island. Burt got famous. Splurged on his wardrobe. Fame never went to his scruffy-haired head. They put their commitment in writing. Crafted their belief in sustainability. Invested in community outreach. And nature? Is still CEO. At the place where it started. At the start of a movement. That started it all.

Pee-Wee football 2015 pick. My son Jason came into this world kicking. My wife said he’d been kicking long before he was even born. And growing up he kicked everything. Balls in the house. The tires on the truck. His little sister. He just wanted to kick. So we bought the cleats, helmet, shoulder pads, and a whole bunch of jerseys with our Citi card. And then we bought the goalpost. Getting it into the truck was interesting. Whatever your story is, your Citi card can help you write it. Citi- let’s get it done.
Citibank knows what its like when you’re starting out. They’ve issued more than 8 million credit cards to young adults and they don’t require a co-signer.
So I lose my credit card… Luckily it’s a Citibank Photocard with my picture on it. This guy in my building finds it. He recognizes me from the photo, he returns it. Not only is he single, honest and good looking - But get this - He’s attracted to Moi! Citibank - The city never sleeps.
Hmmm. Apparently, Mark doesn’t know about Citibank’s low rates on home equity lines of credit. Like Mark, you’ve probably got more equity in your home than you thought. Why not utilize it?

Popular myth would have us believe that a few people are born creative while the rest of us are not. It's much easier to believe in magic than to believe in work, or to believe in divinity rather than struggle. But look a little closer and you will find that creativity is an intrinsic part of being human, and it is written into every person's DNA. 
Many people live their lives oblivious to and alienated from their inherent creative nature. Creativity is not just magic, it is a learnable skill that any person or company can acquire. 
Within creative thinking lives the power of transformation. Through creativity, you can change everything.

Welcome to the virtual tour of Data Center One, or D-C one as we call it. D-C one
is our state-of-the-art, multi-million dollar facility designed to deliver services that
will empower your business. Over 2 years of planning was put into the
development of this data center to ensure that it meets or exceeds data centers
located in large metropolitan areas. Let’s start our tour by taking a look at some of
the structural highlights.
First - this room and the operations center as a whole are set up with one foot thick
steel-reinforced concrete walls, along with an eight-inch steel, reinforced concrete
slab roof. When designing this building, the specifications to withstand a direct
hit from an F5 tornado were effectively doubled.
Additionally, we also have INERGEN fire suppression throughout this room and
the facility. This is the environmentally friendly replacement for Halon, so it's easy
on the electronics and easy on the environment.

I say: "mow" - they say "how high?" Now I love yard work - I could sit and watch it all day long. Green thumb - for people who love to hate yard work.

PIZZA was a novelty you sometimes found at your local Italian restaurant. Most people hadn't even heard of it. In fact, pizza's beginning in the USA can be traced to what many believe was the first pizzeria -- Lombardi's -- which opened in the 1920s in New York City's Little Italy.

I can't believe I used to pay up to 25 cents a minute for my long distance calls. But I did with MCI. I also tried Sprint at 10 cents a minute and AT&T at 7 cents. But now that I've switched to IBC Long Distance, I pay just 5 cents a minute for all state to state calls, all day everyday. It's the best flat rate long distance available. I can talk to my grandkids in the mid-west and my brother in Florida. Why, for 5 cents a minute, a 20-minute call is just one dollar. And unlike those other companies, IBC gives me 6 second billing so I never pay for time I don't use. It takes just one call to IBC --- I'll never switch again.

Outbound marketing methods are things like radio, T.V., print ads and
mailers, which target everyone - whether they need your services or
not. These ads usually bombard people at inconvenient times-when they’re
not even looking for a solution. They can come across as annoying and
people have gotten too good at “tuning out the noise” while technology
has made it easy to block or skip commercials.

Hi, I'm Pecos Red. Ever heard the term: “All Hat and no cattle”?  That’s the problem with a lot of boots – I know.  Sounds weird; but the thing of it is that most boots don’t do the same things your feet do, like expand - and - contract when you take a step.

VO: The digital world makes everything easier … 
… easier to get things done… easier to get what you want… and easier to stay in touch. 
But it does make it harder to keep your personal information protected. 
Because if you’re on an unsecured network… it’s harder to keep your personal information ... personal. 
Did you know something as easy as posting pictures of your daughter’s birthday … 
… might put you both at risk of identity theft? 
Because with a little personal information an identity thief could get at the money in your bank accounts and the equity in your home. They could even hurt your ability to get credit. 
But LifeLock believes you and your family shouldn’t have to give up the benefits of the digital world. 
That’s why LifeLock offers the most comprehensive identity theft protection available – anywhere. 
So enjoy your digital life … and let LifeLock watch out for you. 
With LifeLock’s 24/7 Proactive Protection, you’re alerted by text, phone or email as soon as they detect suspicious activity in their network … 
… before the damage is done. 
VO: It doesn’t matter which devices you use or who you do business with … you’ll feel more secure with LifeLock’s proactive identity theft protection. 
VO: And remember, fraud protection from your credit card is not the same as identity theft protection. 
GIULIANI: Credit card fraud protection only protects your credit card accounts from fraudulent charges, and when an identity thief strikes they’re likely to cause you much bigger problems. You have to be prepared. That’s why I joined LifeLock. 
Let LifeLock’s proactive identity theft protection take care of you and your family.

Nutriforte is an innovative liquid mineral blend for drinking-water, offering readily available minerals and ease of use.
Unlike solid minerals in dry feed, Nutriforte ensures that each individual cow gets the optimal level of minerals tailored to its daily needs.
Nutriforte is easy to administer, has a homogeneous distribution and promotes the health and long(j)evity of your cows.
It's commonly known that milk production is directly related to water intake. Since highly productive cows have a higher mineral requirement and a higher water intake, providing minerals through their water intake will give each cow the right amount of minerals.
Did you know that about 60% of water by-passes the rumen? Minerals are readily available for absorption in the intestines and liquid minerals have a  superior bio-availability compared to dry feed minerals.
Mineral intake via water is not related to dry matter intake. So, in case of stress, illness or hot weather, your cows will get their necessary minerals.
Also, water troughs(trofs) remain clean and you don’t face algae growth.
Nutriforte is easily administered to the water via an automated dosing system, controlled by a computer. Once installed you only have to insert herd size and daily mineral dose rates.
A water meter will measure how many grams of minerals need to be injected per liter of water and will adjust the dose rate automatically based on fluctuations in daily water consumption.
This ensures that each cow will get the minimum required dose of minerals, preventing mineral deficiencies.
Once set, the accuracy of the computer prevents mistakes due to “the human factor”, ensuring homogenous mixing during the day and preventing loss or waste due to surplus feed or dust.

At some banks, overdrawing your business checking account can mean more than just an overdraft charge. Your other banks may be debited to pay for the overdraft, denying you use of your hard-earned funds. With People’s Business Plus Checking and a Business Credit Line, you get true overdraft coverage. With a completely separate credit line that’s linked to your checking account. Any overdraft automatically activates your credit line, and subsequent checking account deposits are credited to your account -- instead of being used to pay your credit line.

When you have defined properly what you are selling, you can better focus your attention on doing the things that matter.  So, what do you sell?  Hopefully, you didn’t answer this question by saying something like cars, insurance, computers, stocks, or buy memberships.  Perhaps you had a better answer, like “SOLUTIONS.”  Well, you’re getting warmer.  You’re selling FEELINGS, pure and simple! Remember the line from the old sales books that states “People buy with emotions, then justify with logic.”  For most people, even veteran salespeople, this fundamental concept can take years to fully understand.  However, when you finally get it, a whole new world opens up for you.  You don’t buy a car because you want a car  You buy a car because it satisfies a particular set of criteria, which in turn, makes you feel good or better than not buying that car.

It's never too early to start saving for college. It's never too late either. There's nothing wrong with dreaming of athletic scholarships. But it might be smart to have a 529 College Savings Plan from TD Waterhouse, just in case. Why? Because every dollar you put in grows tax-deferred. And every dollar you withdraw for college comes out free of federal income tax. So when you pay your kid's college bills, there's no bill from Uncle Sam to go along with it. And anyone can contribute to a 529 plan. Parents, grandparents, even the kids can put in some of that summer job money. (Good luck with that.) There's no annual minimum and you can make total contributions of up to $250,000. So make home videos of those first soccer games. Encourage them to become champions. But somewhere in between, do a little homework and find out how TD Waterhouse can help get your kids to college. It's never too early. And it's never too late. TD Waterhouse. You're in control.

DIRECTION: Commercial campaign to run on cable broadcast and web for an alcoholic beverage. These commercials celebrate Appalachian culture and the region in general. Is should be respectful and reverent treatment of the script. 
It would be nice if the voice was deep, with an accent from the region, but not overpowering. It does not have to have an accent however, it could just be mysterious  
SCRIPT:
Born from Appalachian mud and mist; from passed-down secrets and past-on traditions; born from law abidin’ and law unabidin’; born from calloused hands and broken back; born from deep blue grass and rich Bluegrass; born from good people and shared with the same.

The Pursuit of Happiness.
Call it bad luck or some kind of dulled survival instinct but, doesn’t it always seem like the line you pick to stand in ends up taking the longest? It never fails. Things are moving along great, and then, right in front of you, someone starts writing out a check. And then, you have to stand there while they agonize over whether to put little Xs or little Os in the fraction part. So, as a service to yourself and your fellow shoppers, get the One Card…the Visa Check Card from Bank One. The One Card lets you buy things and get cash directly from your checking account, which means no more writing checks or fumbling for ID. You can even get your One Card personalized with your name and signature right on the front. Best of all, the One Card is accepted at millions of Visa locations, even on-line and on the phone. So, maybe if more people started paying for things with the One Card, we’d all spend a little less time waiting in lines. I mean, just because we’re all getting older, doesn’t mean it has to happen in the dog food isle at the Shop Mart.

Here's to the crazy ones.
The misfits.
The rebels.
The troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes.
The ones who see things differently.
They're not fond of rules.
And they have no respect for the status quo.
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
Because they change things.
They push the human race forward.
And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

JF: I'm Jerry Fletcher. My "Why Push Yourself?" audio tapes have discouraged millions from getting the job they want.
Man: I heard about all the job listings in the Work Place Mega Section and I was really excited about building a  successful career. (lose motivation) But thanks to Fletcher's "Why Push Yourself" program, I never did anything about it. 
JF: My demotivational tapes REALLY work. Just ask Janine Carlson.
Janine: Six months after reading the work place section, I became first on my national sales team. Then I played Fletcher's tapes, and after that I just stopped trying. 
JF: My tapes will have you turning your back on even the best career opportunities. I guarantee it. 
Young woman: I wanted to be a paralegal. When I read the Work Place Mega Section, I wanted to get up right then and call  about this great paralegal job. Then I remembered Fletcher's words: It's just gonna be more work. So I went back to bed.
JF: If my tapes aren't completely demotivating, just send them back for a full refund. 
Anncr: If you don't push yourself, no one else will. Get the Work Place Mega section. Twice the job listings, more career information. Only in this Sunday's Los Angeles times.

It never ceases to amaze me, get sick and everybody has a home remedy. My Aunt Emma's cure all is crushed garlic and Limburger cheese in a sock tied around her neck. “ I never get sick,” she says. That's 'cause nobody can get within 50 yards of the woman. Then there's my cousin Moon Beam from California. Swears by frozen Tofu Daiquiris. And my mother - anytime she hears me sneeze wants to gimme a oil and vinegar rub down. Great - unless you wanna smell like a salad bar for a week. Me, I just go down to Winn Dixie. There, low prices alone make me feel better, and by the time I go pick up some chicken my prescription is ready. That’s because they have a computer back there with a file with my name on it. They know my Doctors name, my allergies, and never once did they ask me to gargle with guacamole!
