PAbLO HONEY

YOU
You are the sun and moon and stars, are you?
And I could never run away from you
You try at working on chaotic things
And why should I believe myself not you?
It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning caught in the fire
You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning caught in the fire
Why?

RIPCORD
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable It's a soul destroyed
You're free until you drop
You're free 'til you've had enough
And you don't understand

No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord

Aeroplane,
Do I mean what I mean?
It's inevitable, inevitable
Oh aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour
On politics and power that you don't understand

No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywnere
With no ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord

CREEP
When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell i'm doing here
I don't belong here

She's running out again
She's running out
She runs runs runs

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

VEGETABLE
I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard
Died hard
Every time you're running out of here
Every time you're running get the fear

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Every time you're running out on me
Every time you're running i can see
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

The waters break, the waters run all over me
The waters break, the waters run and this time you're gonna pay

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

HOW DO YOU?

He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and
He wants to belong
He wants us to listen
He wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby, turned into a powerful freak

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot
But we always forget
A-and he's just like his daddy
'Cause he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies
Anyway that he can
A-no-no-no!

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

PROVE YOURSELF
I can't afford to breath in this town
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to my cathode ray
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I wanna breath
I wanna grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray
But I'm better off dead

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Why?

STOPWHISPERING

And the wise man say I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man say I don't want to hear your voice
But they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering
Start shouting
Stop whispering
Start shouting

And my mother say we spit on you son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is, that there's something wrong
Because i can't find the words and i can't find the songs

Stop whispering
Start shouting
Stop whispering
Start shouting

Dear sir, I have a complaint
Dear sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is

Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway

Stop whispering
Stop whispering
Stop whispering
Stop whispering, start shou...

I CAN'T
Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me
It was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world
Will keep it down

Even though I might
Even though I try
I can't
Even though I might
Even though I try
I can't

So many things that keep
Keep me underground
So many words that I
That I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

And even though I might
Even though I try
I can't
And even though I might
Even though I try
I can't

If you give up on me now i'll be gutted like i've never been before

Even though I might
Even though I try
I can't
Even though I might
Even though I try
I can't
Even though I might
Even though I try
I can't

THINKING ABOUT YOU
been thinking about you
your records are here
your eyes are on my wall
your teeth are over there
but i'm still no one, and you're now a star what do you care?
been thinking about you, and there's no rest
should i still love you still
see you in bed but i'm playing with myself
and what do you care when i'm not there

all the things you got
all the things you need
who bought your cigarettes?
who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?

been thinking about you
so how can you sleep?
these people aren't your friends
they're paid to kiss your feet
they don't know what i know
and why should you care when i'm not there?

all the things you got
all the things you need
who bought your cigarettes?
who bribed the company to come and see you?
been thinking about you

LURGEE

I feel better, I feel better now you've gone
I got better

I got strong
I feel better
I feel better
I feel better now there's nothing wrong
I got better

I got something

ANYONE CAN PLAY GUITAR
destiny, destiny protect me from the world
destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world

here we are with our running and confusion
and i don't see no confusion anywhere

and if the worm does turn
and if london burns i'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
i wanna be in a band when i get to heaven
anyone can play guitar
and they won't be a nothing anymore

grow my hair, grow my hair
i am jim morrison
grow my hair
i wanna be wanna be wanna be jim morrison

here we are with our running and confusion
and i don't see no confusion anywhere

and if the world does turn
and if london burns i'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
i wanna be in a band when i get to heaven
anyone can play guitar
and they won't be a nothing anymore

BLOW OUT

In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool
all wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
Turns stone

I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack up

And everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool
all wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns stone



the bends

PLANET TELEX
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you around

Saying everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it but it will stay strong
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it
You can break all the rules
But still

Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is broken
Everything is broken

Why can't you forget me?
Why can't you forget me?
Why can't you forget me?

JUST
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
and that's why it really hurts, is
You do it to yourself
Just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor
Changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
And soon he'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts is
You do it to yourself
Just you, you and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self

THE BENDS
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aerplane
Falling asleep beside the window pane
My blood'll thicken
I need to wash myself again to hide all the the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared but there's nothing underneath
Who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am i really sinking this low?

Baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no no no

Lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties
I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
Brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky high

Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties
I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
race, race, race

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you

MY IRON LUNG
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung

The headshrinkers
They want everything
My uncle bill
By belisha beacon

We're way too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for our iron lung

The headshrinkers
They want everything
My uncle bill
By belisha beacon

Suck
Suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum
This
This is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung

The headshrinkers
They want everything
My uncle bill
By belisha beacon

And if you're frightened
You could be frightened
You can be
It's OK
And if you're frightened
You could be frightened
You can be
It's OK

HIGH AND DRY

Two jumps in a week I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk & all your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

It's the best thing that you ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing that you've had has gone away
So don't leave me high

Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
don't leave me dry	BLLLET PROOF..I WISH I WAS
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth, tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I was bulletproof

Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bulletproof
So pay me money, take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bulletproof
And bullet proof

FAKE PLASTIC TREES

The green plastic watering can
For a fake chinese rubberplant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
And it wears him out
And it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
if I just turned and ran

And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

If I could be who you wanted
if I could be who you wanted all the time

BLACK STAR
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

Troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but it's 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am i coming to?
I'm gonna melt down

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

BONES
I don't want to be crippled cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

And I used to fly like peter pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

SULK

Tou bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
Sit there and bawl
You're so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disaffected and eager to please

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change

Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep drift away
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul when the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change
[NICE DREAM]
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with her ansaphone
She says that she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)

(Now come on
Now come on
Now come on)

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

STREET SPIRIT [FADE OUT]

Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out

This machine will
Will not communicate these thoughts and this strain I am under
Be a world child form a circle before we all go under

And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death can see its beady eyes

All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love




OK COMPUTER

AIRBAG
In the next world war
A jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

PARANOID ANDROID
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?
What's that?

When I am king you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does

Rain down
Rain down
Come on rain down
On me
From a great height
From a great height
Height
Height

That's it sir (Rain down)
You're leaving
The crackle of pig skin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on rain down on me)
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
God loves his children

SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK ALIEN

The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
And up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me onboard that beautiful ship
Show me the worlds I'd love to see
I'd tell all my friends but they never believe me
They'd think that I've finally lost it completely
I show them the stars and the meaning of life, they'd shut me away but I'd be all right all right

I'm just uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
EXIT MUSIC [FOR A FILM]

Wake
From your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape
Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song, a song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill

And You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
And now we are one
In everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
LET DOWN

Transport
Motorways and tram lines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes its so so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed
Juices flowing
Wings twitch legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

You know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapses
Floating
Bouncing back and one day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

CLIMBING UP THE WALLS

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls	NO SURPRISES

A heart that's full up like
A landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

I'll take a quiet life
And a handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent
Silence

This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please

Such a pretty house and
Such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please
LUCKY
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll
This time
I feel my luck could change
Kill my Sarah
Kill me again
With love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

We are standing on the edge

THE TOURIST

It barks at no else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it seen the sparks a-flowing
No one else would know

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
You ask me where the hell i'm going?
At a thousand feet per second

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
slow down
Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
slow down



KID A

EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE
Kid A, Kid A, Kid A, Kid A
Everything, everything, everything, everything..
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

Everything, everything, everything..
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What is that you tried to say?
What was that you tried to say?
Tried to say.. tried to say..
Tried to say.. tried to say..

Everything, everything, everything..
Everything in its right place

KID A
I slipped away
I slipped on a little white lie

We got heads on sticks
You got ventriloquists
We got heads on sticks
And you got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

Rats and children follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of their homes
Come on kids...

THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
is holding on.

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
is holding on
is holding on

holding on

HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here....

TREEFINGERS	OPTIMISTIC
Flies are buzzing around my head
Vultures circling my dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem give me some

You can try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough


This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload

IN LIMBO
I'm the first in the Irish Sea
Another message I can't read

I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down?

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

You're living in a fantasy world
This beautiful world

MORNING BELL

light another candle
and release me

you can keep the furniture
a bump on the head
howling down the chimney
release me

MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life


Early version has a second verse:
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you

I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life


Amnesiac

PACKT LIKE SARDINES IN A CRUSHED TIN BOX (3:57)

After years of waiting nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize
I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case

After years of waiting
After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize you're looking, looking
in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case

After years of waiting
You're a reasonable man
Get off our case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case

PYRAMID SONG (4:49)

I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moonful of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moonful of of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt


PULL PULK REVOLVING DOORS (4:07)

There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors

Doors on the rudders of big ships
And there are revolving doors
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors
And there are secret doors

There are doors that lock
And doors that don't

There are doors that let you in
And out
But never open
But they are trapdoors
That you can't come back from

YOU AND WHOSE ARMY? (3:10)

Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You forget so easily
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses

We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses... Ghost horses
Ghost horses
I MIGHT BE WRONG (4:51)

I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn
I saw a light coming home
I used to think
I used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times
and never look back
Never look back

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Open up and let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

KNIVES OUT (4:15)

I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back
So knives out
Catch da mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth

Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know
I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out
Catch da mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

THE MORNING BELL AMNESIAC (3:14)

The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle
And release me
Release me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah......
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
you clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round....

Cut the kids in half

DOLLARS AND CENTS (4:52)

There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear wittness
We can uussse
Be constructive with yer blues
Even he turns the water blues
Even you turn the water green

Why don't you quiet down?
Quiet down!

You don't live in a business world
You never go out and you never stay
We'll know our goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe

All over the neighbors, maybe if i can see out there
All over the clovers, All over the clovers, let me out of here
All over...

Why don't you quiet down?
Quiet down!

We are the dollars and cents
And the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
We're going to crack your little souls
We're going to crack your little souls

We are the dollars and cents
And the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
We're going to crack your little souls
Crack your little souls

We are the dollars and cents ....

HUNTING BEARS (2:00)

Instrumental	LIKE SPINNING PLATES (3:57)

While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
you feed me to the lions
A delicate balance
And this just feels like spinning plates
I'm living in a cuckoo land
and this just feels like spinning plates
My bodies floating down the muddy river

LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE (4:35)

Once again I'm in trouble with my only
friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house
Once again packed like frozen food and
battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only
only....
There's someone listening in



Hail to the Thief

2+2=5

({either} Hello {or} We're on)
(That's a nice way to start, isn't it?)
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always makes five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because!

You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

I try to sing along
But the music's all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies but like flies the buggers keep coming back and NOT
But I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the dock
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
Oh go and tell the king that the sky is falling in
When it's not
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not	THE GLOAMING

Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny ha ha, funny how?
When the walls bent, when the walls bent
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bent, when the walls bent
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
They should be ringing

This is the gloaming
SIT DOWN.STAND UP.

Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime (stand up)
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
We can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime
Stand up

THERE THERE

In pitch dark I go walkin' in your landscape
Broken branches trip me as i speak
Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean itﾕs there
Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean itﾕs there
There's always a siren
singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out  )
Steer away from these rocks
we'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out  )
Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
(thereﾕs someone on your shoulder  )
Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
(there's someone on your shoulder  )
There there

Why so green
And lonely
Heaven sent you
To me

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
SAIL TO THE MOON

I sucked the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from
Moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon	I WILL

I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I wonﾕt let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up
Little babies' eyes eyes eyes eyes
Little babies' eyes eyes eyes eyes
Little babies' eyes eyes eyes eyes
Little babies' eyes eyes eyes
BACKDRIFTS

We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, weﾕve got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
Weﾕre backdrifting
There's far but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink
Of honey sweet
So fall asleep
I'm backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So youﾕre backtracking
Oh oh oh

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our
You fell into our

We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell, weﾕve got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
Weﾕre backdrifters 	A PUNCH-UP AT A WEDDING

No { 2}
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there
it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

Hypocrite
Opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round you stay frozen to the spot

The pointless snide remarks
Of hammer-headed sharks
the pot will call the kettle black
it's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah
GO TO SLEEP

Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body
Someone's son or someoneﾕs daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body
Iﾕm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tip toe around, tie him down
We donﾕt want the loonies takinﾕ over
Tip toe around, tie him down
May pretty horses come to you as you sleep
Iﾕm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me	MYXOMATOSIS

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

I don't know
why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I feel
So skinned alive

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know
Why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know
Why I feel so skinned alive

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smart ass but we all like stars
(for a reason) That wasn't my intention (for a reason) I did for a reason (reason)
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis

I donﾕt know
Why I feel so tongue-tied
WHERE I END AND YOU BEGIN

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
I'm sorry for us
The Dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin (4, 5, 6, 7)
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down
I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X'll mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling into the sea
Into the sea
I will eat you alive
Thereﾕll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
Thereﾕll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
There'll no more lies
I will eat you alive  	SCATTERBRAIN

I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rappin' on my windowsill
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole (I only wish i could fall in)
A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain
WE SUCK YOUNG BLOOD

Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

We want the young blood (la  )
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Fleabitten, motheaten?

We suck young blood (la  )
We suck young blood (la  )

Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

We want the sweet meat (la  )
We want the young blood
La

A WOLF AT THE DOOR

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Snaps you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love, it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see 'em again
If I squeal to the cops

No
Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes I stripped her naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and sunday papers.
City boys in first class
Don't know they're born, they know
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up get over get up get over
Turn your tape off.

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see 'em again
If I squeal to the cops

So I just go...


In Rainbows

15step
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?

One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened?
Etcetera etcetera
Fads for whatever
15 steps
Then a sheer drop

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

Bodysnatchers
I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
1 for yes
2 for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out
Ooooohhhh

You killed the sound
removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass
Ooooohhhh

Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped around my face
All the lines wrapped around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see

I'm a lie

I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming

NUDE

Don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
and feel up with noise
but there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
they're not going to happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
Weird Fishes/Arpeggi

In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape...
All I Need

I'm the next act
witing in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
that you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
because there are no others

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong

Faust Arp

One two three four

Wakey wakey
rise and shine
it's on again, off again, on again
watch me fall
like dominoes
in pretty patterns
fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling, tingling, tingling
it's what you feel not
what you ought to, what you ought to
reasonable and sensible
dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but not, not, not
for no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
and take a bow, take a bow, take a bow
it's what you feel now
what you ought to, what you ought to
the elephant that's in the room is
tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
duplicate and triplicate
plastic bags and
duplicate and triplicate
dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but not, not, not
exactly where do you get off?
is enough, is enough
I love you but enough is enough
enough of that stuff
there's no real reason

(You've got a head full of feathers
you got melted to butter)
Reckoner

Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak it's name
Dedicated to all human beings

Because we separate like
ripples on a blank shore
(in rainbows)
Because we separate like
ripples on a blank shore
(in rainbows)

Reckoner
Take me with yer
Dedicated to all human beings

House of Cards
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table,
Get swept under
Denial, denial

The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband goodnight

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table,
And get swept under

Denial, denial
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial

Jigsaw Falling into Place

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again

The walls are bending shape
You got a cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are a sawn off shotgun

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mike
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Jigsaws falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
And not just twice

Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light you can feel it on your back
You got the light you can feel it on your back

Jigsaws falling into place	Videotape

Videotape
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When mephistophilis is just beneath
and he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
and i have it all here in
Red, blue, green
Red, blue, green

You are my center
When i spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
so I'm talking to you before...
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know
today has been the most perfect day
I have ever seen

[instrumental]

Down is the New Up

Down Is the New Up
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without a warning
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup
Down is the new up, is the new up

Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

You're on Candid Camera
The chink in your armor
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town


Go Slowly

Over here
Come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient
Patiently
I didn't
But now I can see

That there's a way out
That there's a way out

That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out	MK2
[instrumental]

Last Flowers

Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little fools

And I can't face the evening straight
And you can offer me escape
Houses live and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, relief, believe

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can offer me escape
Houses live and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, relief, believe
Relief, believe

It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful	Up on the Ladder

I'm stuck in the Tardis
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute snake charming
The next in a motorcade

All the right moves in
In the right percent
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

Up on the ladder
No time to ??
Up on the ladder
You're away from your mistake

Up on the ladder
To call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same
Bangers n Mash

You bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
You bit me, bit me, now I want more

I'm standing in the hall
I'm kicking at the wall
It's all in sound to the conger eel

The bangers and the mash
The negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not

Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you up
Chief of police or vice-chancellor

Lord and Lady, bla bla
The vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I got the poison, poison
and now I want more

If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power
we're changing by the hour

If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark
The dark will stare back
Back into your soul

I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down, when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking at the wall

Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
the poison,I got the poison,I got the poison now
I got the poison	4 Minute Warning

This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground

This is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare

Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around

This is a warning
Four minute warning


The King Of Limbs

Bloom

Open your mouth wide
The universe will sighs
And while the ocean blooms
It’s what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt?
Don’t blow your mind with whys

I’m moving out of orbit
Turning in somesault
Turning in sour salt
A giant turtle’s eyes
As jellyfish float by	Morning Mr. Magpie

You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all
Give it back
You stole it all
Give it back

Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you’ve stolen all the magic
And took my memory

You know you should
But you don’t
You know you should
But you don’t

Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you’ve stolen all the magic
Took my melody
Little by little

Turned so nasty now
The dark’s there
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

Little by little by hook or by crook
I’m such a tease and you’re such a flirt
Once you’ve been around you’ve been around enough

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don’t know where it is I should look

You could want it all, the flag and pole
I’m curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that’s killing you
Killing you

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don’t know where it is I should look

Little by little by hook or by crook
I am such a tease, and you’re such a flirt

Lotus Flower

I would shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want

I would shrink and I would disappear
I would slip into the groove
And cut me up
And cut me up

There’s an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I’ll set you free

Slowly we unfold
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can’t kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We would shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There’s an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I’ll set you free

Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
Just to see what is

The bird that’s flown into my room
Slowly we unfold
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can’t kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart

Codex

Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Flying to our side
No one gets hurt
You’ve done nothing wrong

Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water’s clear
And innocent

The water’s clear
And innocent
Give Up The Ghost

Don’t haunt me
Don’t hurt me

Gather up the lust and soul
In your arms

Gather up the pitiful
In your arms

What seems impossible
In your arms

I think I have had my fill
In your arms

I think I should give up the ghost
In your arms

Separator

It’s like i’ve fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
the sweetest flowers and fruits were hanging from the trees
falling off a giant bird that’s been carrying me
it’s like i’ve fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream

Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I’ve my heart in my mouth

It’s like I’ve fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I’m free of all the weight I’ve been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the Beholder
I’m a fish now, out of water

Falling off a giant bird that’s been carrying me

I fell open, I lay under
At the tea parlour
I lost your number
And once it’s over
Hid back under

If you think this is over, then you’re wrong
If you think this is over, then you’re wrong
If you think this is over, then you’re wrong
If you think this is over, then you’re wrong

It’s like I’ve fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I’m free of all the weight I’ve been carrying
Wake me up
